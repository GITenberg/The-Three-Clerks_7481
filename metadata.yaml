description: Charley Tudor may have passed the civil-service exam for the Internal
  Navigation Office, but he is no gentleman, mixed up as he is with moneylenders and
  barmaids. His friend Alaric is not doing much better, as he is caught embezzling
  money from a trust fund. Henry, Charley's brother, is now responsible for clearing
  Alaric's name and saving the three men from further trouble.
